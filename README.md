# Spark World Cup

We are going to use the supplied data sets to calculate 
some of the [stats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_FIFA_World_Cup_statistics) from the 2014 world cup in Brazil.

There are 4 exercises to complete. The solutions only require a few lines so if you find yourself writing a lot
of code then stop!

Your objective is to get the tests to pass... All the functions you will need are in the following docs:
* [RDD](https://spark.apache.org/docs/1.4.1/api/scala/index.html#org.apache.spark.rdd.RDD)
* [PairedRDD](https://spark.apache.org/docs/1.4.1/api/scala/index.html#org.apache.spark.rdd.PairRDDFunctions)
